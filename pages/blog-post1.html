            <p>Compilers and interpreters are both used to convert code from high-level programming languages (such as Javascript or Python) into machine code, which is composed of binary bits of 0s and 1s that the computer can then run.  
              The main difference between compilers and interpreters is when the machine code is written and what it does with it.</p>
