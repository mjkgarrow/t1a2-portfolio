          C is a middle-level programming langugage, developed in the 1970s. Middle-level means that it can be used to write code low-level programming such as for kernals and drivers, or for high-level programming like making software, games or apps. C was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs to help build the UNIX operating system.

          C language uses a compiler to run, which means the source code as a whole is read before being converted to machine-code. This means that efficiencies can be found by the compiler and the code can be run faster, tt also means that the final machine-code is smaller, there is less memory usage. C can be up to 45,000 times faster than Python.
        </p>

          Since C was created in the '70s, it has a long history of support and community development. There are many libraries available to go along with C's own set of operations and, like Python, there is extensive online support for the language.Because of the efficiency of C code - both in run-time and memory usage - it has formed the basis of many other languages including C++, Java, JavaScript and Python. If you start learning with C you can switch to many other languages quite easily.

          The major downside with C is that it doesn't support modern features such as object oriented programming (OOP), which is the ability to create classes and objects with methods built in. This means that algorithms need to be implementd as a set of function calls rather than object methods. This form of programming allows a developer a much broader range of data manipulation abilities and structures and is the basis of many modern programming languages, so much so that a new language based on C was created with OOP in mind - C++.
