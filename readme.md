# T1A2 Portfolio - Matt Garrow

This is a WIP of my website. I'm creating wireframes now and just establishing the style while also trying to encorporate some features like a drop down menu.

I've chosen to make a clickable drop down menu to make the site more accessible - both on mobile but also with people not using a mouse.

Colour choices are in line with accessability guidelines for appropriate contrast levels and viewing.
