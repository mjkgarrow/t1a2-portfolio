## Purpose:

The main purpose of my website is to showcase who I am, what I like to work on, my resume and my skillset.

The secondary purpose is to demonstrate my front-end abilities, my aesthetic style, my personality and my thoughts on web development.

## Functionality & Features

#### Technology

- This website is mobile-first and has 2 media breakpoints at 600px (for tablets) and 1000px (desktop).

- I utilised flex-box for my styling.

- I used [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for some of the code snippets I used in the blog section. The theme is [atom-one-dark](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/highlight.js@11.6.0/styles/atom-one-dark.css).

#### What I'm proud of:

- I created beautiful looking blog post cards and project cards that included images that scale when you hover over them, without expanding past the size of the containing div. This was a difficult process and took a few days to implement.

- The home page animation was originally bespoke and took a lot of finessing to get the it to work correctly. However, I soon noticed that I wouldn't be able to change the text at a later date without a lot of extra work. So I took the time to refactor my code so that the text could be easily changed and the typing effect would work perfectly.

#### What I struggled with

- I struggled with the right way to do a navigation menu in mobile view. My original thought was to use a hamburger menu, as can be seen in my wireframe. However I abandoned that idea because it didn't match my design language and the menu seemed overly complex to navigate - requiring multiple clicks just to get to a page. I opted instead for a scrolling nav bar at the top that becomes a right-aligned menu at the desktop media breakpoint. This makes it easier for people to quickly go to a page, instead of having to click a burger menu and then the page they want.

- The colour scheme was a tough choice as well. There were so many options and they all looked really great. I changed up the colour scheme about 10 times before settling on a darker aesthetic. This seemed to match with the professional tone while also injecting some bright colour when I needed to.

## Target Audience

This website is for mostly targeted to a front-end employer. It doesn't have much (or any) back-end features and is entirely HTML and CSS.

I made the colourway, images and functionality appeal visually and the styling is about displaying information clearly.

I deviated from my wireframes quite a lot, but they were very helpful in laying out the design.

Colour choices are in line with accessability guidelines for appropriate contrast levels and viewing.
