# T1A2 Portfolio - Matt Garrow

This is a WIP of my website. I'm creating wireframes now and just establishing the style while also trying to encorporate some features like a drop down menu.

I've chosen to make a clickable drop down menu to make the site more accessible - both on mobile but also with people not using a mouse.

Colour choices are in line with accessability guidelines for appropriate contrast levels and viewing.

Current state of website:

Text for main page:
Hi, I'm Matt. Let's make stuff together.

I'm a junior full-stack developer based in Naarm Melbourne but free to do remote work anywhere.

I create elegant, user-friendly and fun websites that are a joy to visit.

My passion is telling stories, engaging with the audience and making sure that we are creating the best product possible.

Text for about me:
Before I was a full-stack web developer I was a video producer with the ABC for over 11 years.

This role took me from working in live news, comedy, radio, current affairs and eventually into digital content making.

After working in the digital space for nearly 4 years I saw an opportunitity to start making a bigger impact online and I began my self-education journey.

Since teaching myself Python and SQL during the pandemic I've started a Diploma of Information Technology from Coder Academy.

With my experience making content for a vast number of Australians, with tight deadlines and around-the-clock focus on the role, I'm perfectly adapted to take on any project you throw at me.
